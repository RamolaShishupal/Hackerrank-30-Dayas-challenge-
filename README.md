# Hackerrank-30-Dayas-challenge-


i solved all problems using python language

day 21 solution is in java becouse 
hackerrank did not allow to code in python for this perticular code 
which is to print the list of elements at next line 
which would be very easy in python 

just be patience when u did not get proper output or only some test cases are not going to work 

just check them and allow urself to think more widely 

All the best and take this challenge 
its going to be more fun and u also able to make a habit of coding daily
